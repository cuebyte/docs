A Jekyll like, static document site, using Spring Boot.

This program will find & render the `.md` file dynamically, and the URL is related to the dir that you store the `.md` files.

We only need to upload a Markdown file to the server, then we will see it automatically, just like Jekyll.

**NOTE**: modify the `my.path` value on `application-dev.properties` to config your path of Markdown files.
